This website is provided by Stichting Data Rights pursuant to legitimate interests of providing information to the general public.

Your personal data (e.g. your IP address and other technical information) are processed for the technical purpose of serving pages you request.

Other purposes that we will pursue include: ensuring the security of our website (e.g. storing truncated IP addresses and monitoring requests to prevent denial of services, etc.), and having general statistics (excluding any individual user tracking).

The website is currently hosted by Gitlab Pages. We will update this policy soon with information required under the GDPR (or change provider or host ourselves).

We are looking for technical contributions. If you want to help, [contact](/contact) us.
