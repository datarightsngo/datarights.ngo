    We believe that users should not have to trade their data and autonomy in exchange for big tech’s cybersecurity. We refuse mass surveillance as the Internet’s business model. We challenge Governments where their actions undermine cybersecurity, the rule of law, and fundamental rights.
    
    We believe in a world where users, communities and organisations have the rights to control their data, free from data silos and mass surveillance.
    
    Data Rights was founded in 2020 to make this vision come true.

Data Rights is a non-governmental organization with a mission to empower users, organisations and communities, to control their data. 

## Who we are

We gather activists, hackers, cybersecurity experts, lawyers, designers, programmers… people who care about the impact of data, and want to fight for a vibrant Internet, free from unfair State or business surveillance.
