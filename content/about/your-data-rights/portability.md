Individuals have the right to obtain the data they provided, and to transmit them to another provider without hindrance.

Open standards for **machine-readable** formats and open protocols for **interoperability** are necessary to guarantee this. Where technically feasible, the right to data portability should be convenient and data made accessible through **APIs**.

## GDPR

 - [Article 20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e2753-1-1) provides the right to data portability.
