Data Rights (in the name of its funder, Lori Roussey) was admitted to intervene at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in support of Privacy International and five other NGOs to provide the Court with a comparative legal perspective on the implications of intelligence servicesâ€™ resort to equipment interference, and the negative effects of a legal regime that does not provide effective remedy.
