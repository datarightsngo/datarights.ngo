## Priority preliminary ruling request (QPC) on wireless communications surveillance to the French Council of State

<div class="event-date">May 6 2016</div>

The QPC is a French Constitutional Law procedure allowing persons involved in a¬†**pending case**¬†to ask the court they are before to suspend the proceedings and pass on an overarching question the Constitutional Council to assess the constitutionality of laws relating to the case at hand. Here the QPC was made possible as part of the pending case we had started before the French Council of State on the Decrees of the Intelligence Law reform of 2015.

Indeed, during the intelligence regulation reform of 2015 the Parliament chose to maintain the ‚Äúwireless exception‚Äù introduced in French law in 1991. At the time supposed to cover military communications, the rise of mobile communications and wireless networks made this provision totally obsolete, grossly disproportionate and source of abuse by the police and intelligence services ([as in the case of the fadettes of Le Monde](https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/affaire-des-fadettes-squarcini-condamne), where phone bills of journalists were intercepted).

Cases¬†N<sup>ers</sup>: QPC 2016-590, 394922, 394924, 394925, 397844, 397851

Cases gathering non-profit Internet service providers French Data Network, FDN Federation, Igwan.net and  the Quadrature du Net organisation, together with the Spinosi & Sureau law firm.

## QPC transmission to the French Constitutional Council

<div class="event-date">July 22 2016</div>

Based on our briefs the French Council of State [concluded there were indeed doubts on the consitutionality of the provision on wireless communications](https://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/arianeweb/CE/decision/2016-07-22/394922). The Council of State therefore transmitted our question to the Constitutional Council[](http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/arianeweb/CE/decision/2016-07-22/394922).

## Repeal of the intelligence loophole, deemed unconstitutional

<div class="event-date">Oct. 21 2016</div>

The Constitutional Council [declares article 24 of the Intelligence Law contrary to the Declaration of Human and Civil Rights of 1789](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2016/2016590QPC.htm). It notes that the ‚Äúwireless exception‚Äù allows the collection of personal data and the interception of communications and that these intelligence measures are not subject ‚Äú\*to any substantive or procedural conditions\*‚Äùand limited by ‚Äú\*no guarantee\*".

This "\*manifestly disproportionate interference with the right to respect for private life and the secrecy of correspondence\*" is contrary to Article 2 of the Declaration of 1789. That being said, the Council considers that "\*public authorities should not be deprived of any possibility of monitoring wireless transmissions\*" and therefore postponed the effect of its decision to more than a year.

<div class="event-date">Dec. 31 2017</div>

Entry into force of the repeal of article 24 of the Intelligence Law.
