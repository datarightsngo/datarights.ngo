## Repeal request

<div class="event-date">Aug. 5 2016</div>

There is no procedural avenue in France that allows a citizen to appeal directly to the Constitutional Council if a law contrary to the Constitution has been promulgated. The steps followed in this case are therefore:\

1. Asking the government to repeal a regulatory text related to the law contrary to the Constitution (in our case, a decree implementing the Intelligence Law, see example below);
2. Await for a negative response or, in the absence of a response, await for the end of the legal period allowing us to deem that the absence of a response constituting an implicit refusal decision.

The government's refusal to repeal a regulatory provision may be the subject of an appeal for “excess of power” before the Council of State.

## Partial repeal of the law prolongating the French state of emergency measures

<div class="event-date">Aug. 4 2017</div>

The Constitutional Council [declares part of the article contrary to the Declaration of Human and Civic Rights of 1789](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2017/2017648QPC.htm).

The Council noted that the law extending the state of emergency measures "\*made it possible for a large number of people to be the subject of this \[real-time interception] technique, without their link to the threat necessarily being close\*" without providing for any substantial limitation such as a maximum number of authorisations.

However, without justifying it, the Constitutional Council postponed the effects of its ruling, deciding that the immediate repeal of this recent law's provision would entail "manifestly excessive consequences".

Entry into force of the repeal.
