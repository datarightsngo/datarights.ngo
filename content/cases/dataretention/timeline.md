Title: "France’s Data Retention Laws and the 2015 Intelligence Act"
Introduction: " This legal challenge aims to uphold the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU on bulk data retention and real-time analysis in France."
---


Following the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) ruling, the case is now back to the French Council of State (or Conseil d'État).  
*Details of the case are only available in French. [See how to participate to translations](/action/translate/)*

<div class="event-date">Dec. 2014</div>

Following the *Digital Rights* judgment of the CJEU, French Data Network initiates a legal action to enforce European case law in France, where the general retention of electronic communications data (often called meta data) exists since September 2001.

## Request for repeal

<div class="event-date">Apr. 27 2015</div>

While Parliament debates the Intelligence Act which provides - among other things - for new techniques to process communications data, the first step in this case is to request the government for the repeal of the decrees organizing the general retention of data in France (R.10-13 of the French the Postal and Electronic Communications Code and Decree 2011-219 implementing the French Law on confidence in the digital economy (LCEN)).

The decrees dating back from 2006 and 2011, an action directed against them is no longer legally allowed. This repeal request therefore aimed to open a judicial remedy before the French Council of State (or Conseil d'État) for an action against the general retention of communication data (often referred to as metadata).

Promulgation of the Intelligence Law (law n<sup>o</sup> 2015-912, later referred to as two laws thanks to our victory on international surveillance provisions), which provides for several implementing decrees which will be published in the following autumn and winter, opening the possibility of appeal before the French Council of State.

### [Priority Preliminary ruling request on wireless surveillance before the French Constitutional Council](../../wireless-exception)


Filing of a Priority Preliminary ruling for the French Constitutional Council (QPC) due to the discovery of a vast legal loophole created in 1991. This loophole meanthad survived the wide ranging 2015 reform and stated that all communications via wireless means would not be granted any of the safeguards created by the 2015 reform. In practice, this meant that most of today's communications (e.g. via wifi, rfid, blouetooth) remained easy to surveil with absolutely no proportionality legal safeguards from abuse. This filing was arguing before the French Constitutional Council that such a provision could simply not be deemed constitutional. We won the QPC - the vast loophole on wireless communications interception with no oversight is now history.

Procedural detail on QPCs: The QPC is a French Constitutional Law procedure allowing persons involved in a **pending case** to ask the Constitutional Council to assess the constitutionality of laws relating to the case at hand. Here the QPC was made possible as part of the pending case we had started on the Decrees of the Intelligence Law.

## CJEU ruling and back to the French Council of State

<div class="event-date">Oct. 6 2020</div>

The Court of Justice of the European Union highlighted the failings of surveillance laws in France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. The EU’s highest court is thus paving the way for structural reforms of European surveillance laws.
