## Where is the content to be translated?

The source content of the website is available at <https://gitlab.com/datarights/website/-/tree/master/content>.

Pages in English are files like “title-of-page.md” and translations end with a two-letter language code, e.g. for French “title-of-page.fr.md”


## How to start a translation? (the quick version)

Found a page that needs translation?

For instance, to translate this current page, you can

 1. go to <https://gitlab.com/datarights/website/-/tree/master/content/action/translate.md> (the link to the page is also available in the footer for non-translated pages)

 2. translate the content of the page and send us the translated file

If you start to contribute more, you may want to integrate your translation work with our tools to make the process more efficient.
