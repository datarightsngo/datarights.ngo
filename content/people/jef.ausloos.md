Jef Ausloos is working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information law (IViR), where he is part of the personalised communications project team. His research interests center around data-driven power asymmetries and the normative underpinnings of individual control, empowerment and autonomy in the modern-day, largely privatised information ecosystem. 

Before joining IViR in December 2018, Jef was a doctoral researcher at the University of Leuven’s Center for IT & IP Law (CiTiP). He worked on a variety of projects in media and data protection law and in October 2018 he obtained his PhD entitled ‘The right to erasure: safeguard for informational self-determination if a digital society?’. 

Jef holds degrees in law from the Universities of Namur, Leuven and Hong Kong. He has worked as an International Fellow at the Center for Democracy & Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been on research stays at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society (Harvard University) in 2012; the Institute for Information Law (University of Amsterdam) in 2015; and the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law (Cambridge University) in 2017.
